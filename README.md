KEY INSIGHTS:
 ‚Ä¢ Engineering has the highest budget ($2.4M), while Human Resources has the lowest ($800K).
 ‚Ä¢ Marketing and IT have moderate allocations ($1.6M and $900K, respectively).
 ‚Ä¢ Sales has a budget of $1.2M, which is relatively lower compared to Engineering and Marketing.
‚Ä¢ The total project budget is $570K, which is a small fraction of the total departmental budget ($6.9M).
 ‚Ä¢ Sales has the highest project budget at $150K, followed by Marketing ($115K) and Human Resources ($105K).
 ‚Ä¢ IT has the lowest project budget at $90K, despite its goal of improving IT infrastructure.
 ‚Ä¢ Total salary cost is $2.08M.
 ‚Ä¢ Engineering and IT have high salary costs, which is expected due to technical expertise requirements.
 ‚Ä¢ Human Resources has a lower salary allocation, which might limit talent acquisition and retention.
 ‚Ä¢ Engineering has the highest capital ($930K), while Human Resources has the lowest ($135K).
 ‚Ä¢ IT is also at risk with only $209K in capital.
 ‚Ä¢ The Human Resources and IT departments appear financially constrained compared to their objectives.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
 ‚Ä¢ Increase funding for IT infrastructure since its project budget ($90K) is the lowest. IT improvements often enhance overall business operations.
 ‚Ä¢ Consider adjusting Human Resources funding ($135K capital is quite low), as employee engagement and talent management are crucial.
 ‚Ä¢ Review Marketing‚Äôs high budget allocation ($1.6M) to ensure it aligns with expected ROI.
 ‚Ä¢ Engineering and IT have high salary costs; consider efficiency improvements or automation to optimize workforce expenses.
 ‚Ä¢ Human Resources might need a slight salary budget increase to attract skilled employees and improve employee engagement.
 ‚Ä¢ Ensure smaller projects (e.g., Market Research, CRM Integration) receive adequate funding since they contribute to long-term business growth.
 ‚Ä¢ Since IT and HR have low capital, track their spending closely to avoid resource shortages.
 ‚Ä¢ Monitor the yearly burn rate to ensure the 2yr budget covers all expenses.
 ‚Ä¢ Set up early warnings for departments nearing budget limits to prevent budget deficit.
